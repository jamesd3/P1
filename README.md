# HTML and CSS Project 1
by James DeLapa

## Project Summary and Purpose:
* **Purpose:** Project 1 was to take a PDF document (https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) and create a web-page based off the document.

* Additional instructions were to "make it your own" so I did just that.

* Website utilizes bootstrap for responsive formatting.

* zig-zag border attributes: https://localmotors.com/blog/post/zig-zag-borders-in-css/1205/
  - After seeing the zig-zag border I wanted to implement it on my page. Modified the zig-zag triangles to make the pattern my own.
  - The original version had only bottom-border based zig-zag (*:after) patterns as well as a small visible line which I assume was an error. Fixed on my site.


## Other Notes

Project Originally Completed February 2016 as part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. Updates will be noted in a changelog to be created if there are any changes.
